The Gaming Room Project Reflection

1. Client and Software Requirements
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to multiple operating platforms. The software needed to support multiple instances of the game at once, allow several teams and players to compete, and ensure that no duplicate games were created. The system also needed to manage game state, players, and teams while maintaining strong security and performance.

2. What I Did Well
I think I did well in organizing the document so it clearly explained the system’s purpose and architecture. The design document covered everything from operating system recommendations to memory management and security considerations, and I made sure it was written so both technical and non-technical readers could understand it.

3. Helpful Parts of the Process
Working through the software design document helped me understand how to plan a system before coding. It made it easier to think about how the application’s components would connect, what data would be needed, and what kind of structure would make future development smoother.

4. What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would improve the diagrams and formatting to make them look more professional. Adding clearer visual explanations for the architecture and relationships between components would make the document easier to follow.

5. Understanding and Meeting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, multi-user functionality, and security. These were all important to The Gaming Room’s goal of expanding to new platforms. Understanding user needs is key in design because the software has to solve their specific problem, not just function technically.

6. My Approach to Software Design
I approached the design by breaking down the system into smaller parts—identifying the main functions, users, and how data would move through the system. In the future, I would use the same structured approach, starting with requirement gathering, creating diagrams, and verifying that all client goals are met before coding begins.
